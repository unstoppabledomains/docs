# Receive Your Payouts

## Stripe Payouts

Stripe payouts occur daily directly from Stripe and can be tracked within the reseller dashboard by clicking on the “View Test Dashboard” or “View Live Dashboard” button depending on which payouts are being tracked.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **View Live Dashboard** and **View Test Dashboard** buttons will only appear after the Stripe Live or Stripe Test options are successfully connected, linking your Stripe and UD Reseller Accounts.
{% endhint %}

### Stripe Payouts Tab

Clicking either of the “View Dashboard” buttons displays the main tab of the payouts screen, which lists all transactions with dates and payment amounts. The figure below shows the main view of the Payouts screen.

## CoinBase Payouts

CoinBase payouts are manually processed by Unstoppable Domains within 5 business days of receiving the payout request and only after the reseller has earned at least $600 in CoinBase sales. Resellers can request a CoinBase payout in the UD Reseller Dashboard by clicking on the “Request Payout” button.

{% hint style="info" %}
The “Request Payout” button is grayed out and automatically appears after the Reseller account has earned a minimum of $600 in CoinBase sales.
{% endhint %}

Resellers can receive CoinBase payouts via Stripe or Ethereum. This information is discussed and setup with the UD Finance Team before processing the initial CoinBase payout.
