# Get A Test Domain

To make integrations easier, Unstoppable Domains allows developers to request a free `.crypto` domain. To distinguish these test domains from paid domains, all test domains are prefixed with `udtestdev-`. For example:

* `udtestdev-freedomainisawesome.crypto`
* `udtestdev-test-wallet-integration.crypto`

To prevent abuse, we ask that developers cover the cost of minting and transferring these domains to their wallets. **Unstoppable Domains does not make any money from issuing test domains.**

You can get your test domains on the Unstoppable Website Faucet or by direct smart contract calling using Etherscan.

## Get a domain using Unstoppable Website faucet

[Claim your domain](https://unstoppabledomains.com/developers)

## Get a domain using Etherscan

### Requirements

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or any wallet with [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/wallets) support
* Ether on your Ethereum wallet to pay transaction fees

To calculate the transaction fee you'd like to target you can use services like [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/calculatorTxV.php). The average transaction gas usage to mint and transfer a new domains is around 180,000 gas.

### Get a domain

* Open the domain request Smart Contract using [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1fC985cAc641ED5846b631f96F35d9b48Bc3b834#writeContract)
* To get a test domain on testnet find Smart Contract address in [reference table](domain-registry-essentials/cns-smart-contracts.md#freeminter)

**IMPORTANT: If transaction takes more gas than expected \(more than 200,000 gas to call the claim method\) or fails, that domain name may be already claimed. Double check it's available and** [**contact us**](https://discord.gg/b6ZVxSZ9Hn) **if you continue to have problems.**
