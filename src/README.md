# Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
Unstoppable Domains has introduced a major documentation update. The old Website API documentation is available at [apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/).
{% endhint %}

This documentation is both an educational and a technical resource. We hope it will be equally useful for both technical and non-technical readers.

## I want to learn more about Unstoppable Domains

Unstoppable Domains are decentralized. This makes them, in a word, unstoppable. Once a user claims a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain. Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

To learn more about the company, please browse our [general website](https://unstoppabledomains.com), watch the learning materials and videos from our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/UnstoppableDomains/videos), and listen to our popular, educational [UD Podcast Channel](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZlyOpkkprGKS5KODk1PSS).

To learn more about how the product works under the hood, see the [Architecture Overview](domain-registry-essentials/architecture-overview.md) page and the [Smart Contracts Reference](domain-registry-essentials/cns-smart-contracts.md). Also visit the [List of Integrated Apps](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) to draw inspiration from other apps that have successfully integrated Unstoppable Domains.

## I want to add Unstoppable Domains to my app to send and receive crypto

Unstoppable Domains supports 260+ cryptocurrencies. The most common way to integrate with Unstoppable Domains is through [simple domain resolution](domain-registry-essentials/resolving-domain-records.md). This process converts cryptocurrency addresses to a human-readable or user-friendly name. See the guides on [Crypto Payments](send-and-receive-crypto-payments/crypto-payments.md), [Library Configuration](send-and-receive-crypto-payments/library-configuration.md), and [Domain GUI Configuration](send-and-receive-crypto-payments/domains-configuration.md) for more detail on integrating UD into your app.

## I want support Unstoppable Domains in my web browser

Allow your users of your browser to create and view decentralized websites. Individuals control their own content and identity with a decentralized website. The website is **decentralized**, by being created on the Ethereum blockchain, and the domain is stored in a user’s wallet, just like a cryptocurrency. This means that no one can delete content \(such as blogs, podcasts, artwork, social media\) or move it around other than the domain owner. See the guides on [Resolving Domains in a Browser](support-unstoppable-domains-in-a-web-browser/resolving-domains-in-a-browser.md) and [Browser Resolution Algorithm](support-unstoppable-domains-in-a-web-browser/browser-resolution-algorithm.md). For a list of test domains, see [Browser Resolution Test Domains](support-unstoppable-domains-in-a-web-browser/test-domains.md).

## I want to allow my users to manage their existing domains

Your app can edit domain metadata manually with a direct connection to the appropriate blockchain. We strongly recommend prior experience with blockchain development before starting this type of integration.

* [Managing Domain Records](allow-my-users-to-manage-existing-domains/managing-domain-records.md)
* [Managing Domain Ownership](allow-my-users-to-manage-existing-domains/managing-domain-ownership.md)

Popular open-source crypto wallet, MyEtherWallet, has implemented domain management and can be used as a reference implementation.
