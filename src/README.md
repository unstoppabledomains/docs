# Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
Unstoppable Domains has introduced a major documentation update. The old Website API documentation is available at [apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/).
{% endhint %}

This documentation is both an educational and a technical resource. We hope it will be equally useful for both technical and non-technical readers.

## I want to learn more about Unstoppable Domains
Unstoppable Domains are decentralized. This makes them, in a word, unstoppable. Once a user claims a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain. Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

To learn more about the company, please browse our [general website](https://unstoppabledomains.com), watch the learning materials and videos from our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/UnstoppableDomains/videos), and listen to our popular, educational [UD Podcast Channel](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZlyOpkkprGKS5KODk1PSS).

To learn more about how the product works under the hood, see the [Architecture Overview](domain-registry-essentials/architecture-overview.md) page and the [Smart Contracts Reference](domain-registry-essentials/cns-smart-contracts.md). Also visit the [List of Integrated Apps](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) to draw inspiration from other apps that have successfully integrated Unstoppable Domains.

## I want to add Unstoppable Domains to my app to send and receive crypto
Unstoppable Domains supports 260+ cryptocurrencies. The most common way to integrate with Unstoppable Domains is through [simple domain resolution](domain-registry-essentials/resolving-domain-records.md). This process converts cryptocurrency addresses to a human-readable or user-friendly name. See the guides on [Crypto Payments](integrations/crypto-payments.md), [Library Configuration](integrations/library-configuration.md), and [Domain GUI Configuration](integrations/domains-configuration.md) for more detail on integrating UD into your app.

## I want support Unstoppable Domains in my web browser
Allow your users of your browser to create and view decentralized websites. Individuals control their own content and identity with a decentralized website. The website is **decentralized**, by being created on the Ethereum blockchain, and the domain is stored in a user’s wallet, just like a cryptocurrency. This means that no one can delete content (such as blogs, podcasts, artwork, social media) or move it around other than the domain owner. See the guides on [Resolving Domains in a Browser](browser-resolution/resolving-domains-in-a-browser.md) and [Browser Resolution Algorithm](browser-reolution/browser-resolution-algorithm.md). For a list of test domains, see [Browser Resolution Test Domains](browser-resolution/test-domains.md).

## I want to allow my users to manage their existing domains
Your app can edit domain metadata manually with a direct connection to the appropriate blockchain. We strongly recommend prior experience with blockchain development before starting this type of integration.

- [Managing Domain Records](managing-domains/managing-domain-records.md)
- [Managing Domain Ownership](managing-domains/managing-domain-ownership.md)

Popular open-source crypto wallet, MyEtherWallet, has implemented domain management and can be used as a reference implementation.

## I want to sell domains to users in my app
If you want to resell domains, use our [Website API reference](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/) for the Reseller API.

## I want to promote my UD integration
We offer free advertising for UD integrated apps. Once your app has a working Unstoppable Domains integration, [register it here](https://unstoppabledomains.com/app-submission). Registered apps appear on the Unstoppable Domains [homepage](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) and [Applications](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) page — putting your app in front of tens of thousands of potential customers per day.

Also, every week we select a newly-integrated app to feature in the Unstoppable Update newsletter. This newsletter is delivered to~100,000 crypto fanatics — all of whom could become new customers to grow your business.
