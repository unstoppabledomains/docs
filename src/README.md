# Who We Are

{% hint style="info" %}
Unstoppable Domains has introduced a major documentation update. The old Website API documentation is available at [apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/).
{% endhint %}

Unstoppable Domains is a San Francisco-based company building blockchain-based domains. These domains replace cryptocurrency addresses with human-readable names and are powered by the Ethereum and Zilliqa blockchains.

Unstoppable Domains are decentralized. This makes them, in a word, **unstoppable**. Once a user claims a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain.
Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains.
Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

See the [Architecture Overview](domain-registry-essentials/architecture-overview.md) for more detail on our Crypto and Zilliqa Name Services (CNS and ZNS, respectively).
