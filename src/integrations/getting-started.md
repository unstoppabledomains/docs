# Getting Started

This documentation is both an educational and a technical resource. We hope it will be equally useful for both technical and non-technical readers. To get the most out of this documentation, we recommend a basic familiarity with how traditional domains and blockchain systems work.
* First-time readers may want to start with our overview guide of [how CNS domains work](../domain-registry-essentials/cns-smart-contracts.md).  
* Those building an integration may want to start with our guides and documentation for [resolving and managing domains](../domain-registry-essentials/resolving-domain-records.md) and our [language-specific resolution libraries](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains?q=resolution), which may be helpful in translating the examples. Most of our code examples are written in JavaScript and, of course, Solidity.

## I want to learn more about Unstoppable Domains
You can start with the [Who We Are](README.md) page inside these docs or visit the [List of Integrated Apps](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) to see other developers who have successfully used our product. To get a better sense of our people and company culture, please browse our [general website](https://unstoppabledomains.com), watch the learning materials and videos from our [our Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/UnstoppableDomains/videos), and listen to our popular, educational [UD Podcast Channel](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZlyOpkkprGKS5KODk1PSS).

## I want to use Unstoppable Domains for payments in my app (e.g., wallets)

Unstoppable Domains supports 80+ cryptocurrencies and counting. The most common way to integrate with Unstoppable Domains is through simple domain resolution. This process converts cryptocurrency addresses to a human-readable or user-friendly name. See the guides on [Crypto Payments](crypto-payments.md), [Library Configuration](library-configuration.md), and [Domain GUI Configuration](domains-configuration.md) for more detail on integrating UD into your app or website.

## I want to build or setup a website using my Unstoppable Domain

You control your own content and identity with a decentralized website. Your website is **decentralized**, by being created on the Ethereum blockchain, and the domain is stored in a user’s wallet, just like a cryptocurrency. This means that no one can delete content (such as blogs, podcasts, artwork, social media) or move it around other than the domain owner. See the guides on [Resolving Domains in a Browser](../browser-resolution/resolving-domains-in-a-browser.md) and [Browser Resolution Algorithm](../browser-reolution/browser-resolution-algorithm.md). For a list of test domains, see [Browser Resolution Test Domains](../browser-resolution/test-domains.md).

## I want to manage my existing domains

Editing domain metadata can be done manually by a direct connection with the appropriate blockchain. We strongly recommend prior experience with blockchain development before starting this type of integration.

- [Smart contracts reference](../domain-registry-essentials/cns-smart-contracts.md)
- [Managing domain records](../managing-domains/managing-domain-records.md)
- [Managing domain ownership](../managing-domains/managing-domain-ownership.md)

MyEtherWallet has implemented domain management and can be used as a reference implementation.

## I want to resell my domains

If you want to resell domains, use our [Website API reference](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/).

## I want to share or advertise my UD integrated app

We offer free advertising for UD integrated apps. Once your app has a working Unstoppable Domains integration, [register it here](https://unstoppabledomains.com/app-submission). Registered apps appear on the Unstoppable Domains [homepage](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) and [Applications](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) page — putting your app in front of tens of thousands of potential customers per day.

Also, every week we select a newly-integrated app to feature in the Unstoppable Update newsletter. This newsletter is delivered to straight into the inbox of ~100,000 crypto fanatics — all of whom could become new customers to grow your business.

## I want to get support or connect with other developers
